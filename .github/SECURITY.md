# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please help us by following these steps:

1. **Do Not Publicly Disclose**
   - Do not create a public issue. Instead, report the vulnerability privately.

2. **How to Report**
   - Contact the project maintainers directly on Discord: **referr_**
   - Include as much detail as possible (steps to reproduce, code snippets, logs, etc.).

3. **Response**
   - The maintainers will respond to your report within a reasonable time frame.
   - Once the issue is confirmed, we will work with you on a fix and coordinate disclosure.

## Supported Versions

We generally support the latest major release. Security fixes may not be backported to older versions.
